# Automated Traffic Sign Detection using YOLOv8

This project implements an automated traffic sign detection system using the YOLOv8 object detection model.  
The system is capable of detecting traffic signs from images and videos, supporting intelligent transportation and road safety applications.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook `notebook/Traffic_sign_detection_System.ipynb` in Google Colab  
2. Upload the dataset or connect it using Roboflow  
3. Run all cells to train or test the YOLOv8 model  
4. View detection results on images and videos
